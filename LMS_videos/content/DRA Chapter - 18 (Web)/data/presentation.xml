			<text>FAIR PRACTICES CODE FOR DEBT COLECTION
INTRODUCTION 
The Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act was enacted in 2002 by Government of India. 
The Act allowed banks to take possession of assets of defaulting borrowers and charged to the banks without going through the difficult legal process. 
The Reserve Bank of India, in consultation with Government of India and some banks and financial institutions finalized a set of codes called "the Fair Practices Code for Lenders" and advised banks to adopt the guidelines individually. 
All banks have framed their own set of Fair Practices Codes and implemented it from 1st November 2003.They are as follows:</text>

			<text>LOAN APPRAISAL AND TERMS/CONDITIONS 
In the case of lending under consortium arrangement, the participating lenders should evolve procedures to complete appraisal of proposals in time bound manner to the extent feasible, and communicate their decisions on financing or otherwise within a reasonable time. 
As far as possible, the loan agreement should clearly stipulate credit facilities that are solely at the discretion of lenders. 
These may include approval or disallowance of facilities, such as, drawings beyond the sanctioned limits, honouring cheques issued for the purpose other than specifically agreed to in the credit sanction, and disallowing drawing on a borrower account of non-compliance with the terms of sanction.</text>

Post disbursement supervision by lenders, particularly in respect of loans upto Rs.2 lakh, should be constructive with a view to taking care of any "lender related" genuine difficulty that the borrower may face. 
Before taking a decision to recall/accelerate payment or performance under the agreement or seeking additional securities, lenders should give notice to borrowers, as specified in the loan agreement or a reasonable period, if no such condition exists in the loan agreement. 
Lenders should release all securities on receiving payment of loan or realization of loan subject to any legitimate right or lien for any other claim lenders may have against borrowers.

			<text>POST DISBURSEMENT SUPERVISION 
Lenders should restrain from interference in the affairs of the borrowers except for what is provided in the terms and conditions of the loan sanction documents (unless new information, not earlier disclosed by the borrower, has come to the notice of the lender). 
Lenders must not discriminate on grounds of sex, caste and religion in the matter of lending. However, this does not preclude lenders from participating in credit-linked schemes framed for weaker sections of the society. 
In the matter of recovery of loans, the lenders should not resort to undue harassment viz. persistently bothering the borrowers at odd hours, use of muscle power for recovery of loans etc.

			<text>POST DISBURSEMENT SUPERVISION 
GENERAL 
In case of receipt of request for transfer of a loan account, either from the borrower or from a bank/financial institution, which proposes to take-over the account, the consent or otherwise i.e., objection of the lender, if any, should be conveyed within 21 days from the date of receipt of request. 
 Apart from the Fair Practices Code, every bank has laid down appropriate grievance redressal mechanism within the organization to resolve disputes arising in this regard. 
Such a mechanism ensures that all disputes arising out of the decisions of functionaries of lending institutions are heard and disposed of at least at the next higher level. 
The banks also conduct periodical review of the compliance of the Fair Practices Code and the functioning of the grievances redressal mechanism at various levels of controlling offices. Banks have also put on their website the 'Fair Practices Code', adopted by them and given wide publicity.</text>
