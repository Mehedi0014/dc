			<notes>Form III contains the balance sheet figures. Banks would check whether past two years figures are filled up correctly or not . Besides current year’s estimates and next years projections are also filled up after proper validation . 
However , before filling up Form III , certain adjustments are made . Bankers would carry out adjustment for filling up form III assets and liabilities . Major adjustments are carried out to exclude certain items from current assets .  We shall discuss in details in subsequent slides. 

Besides , contingent liability would be filled up in the annexure of Form III. Please note that this part is kept blank in most of the cases and bankers ignore this part . This is due to the fact that numbers from this section are not used for assessment of fund based limit .

			<notes>As discussed in the previous slide , Form III contains data from Balance Sheet . As a banker you should adopt following  process for filling up Form III : 

Step 1 : Find out balance sheet figures of assets and liabilities of last two years .  This data is taken from audited financials of last two years . In case the audited figures are not available for the latest year , provisional figures with declaration is taken .
Step 2 : Classify the assets into two categories namely current assets and non current assets . In the case of current assets classification , banks would exclude certain parts of current assets present in the accounts . 
Step 3 : Classify other assets other than current asset into two categories namely  Fixed Asset and Non Current Assets . In the case of Non Current Asset , the figures are incorporated directly from audited accounts as well as from current assets . 
Step 4 : Total sources of fund is segregated into two categories namely equity and out side liability . 
Step 5 : Total outside Liability is segregated into current Liability and non current Liability . 

Let us explain above steps with the help of an example : 

Customer has submitted a balance sheet . From the balance sheet , as on March 31, 2018, Banks have found out Assets and Liabilities . Once Banks found out Assets and Liabilities , they have grouped the assets into three categories namely Net Fixed Asset , Investment and Current Asset . In this case , the net fixed asset amount is Rupees 100 million , Investment Rs 50 million and Current Assets Rupees 450 million.
Out of the total current asset , inventory comprises of Rupees 150  million , receivable comprises of Rupees 200 million , Loans and Advances to group compay comprises of Rupees 50 million , Other current asset comprises of Rupees 20 million and cash and bank of Rupees 30 million . Banks have also found out that there is no receivable outstanding of more than 6 months old. 
Now it is the turn of bankers to regroup total sources of fund .  Net worth has been found out at Rupees  200 million and the total outside Liability has been calculated at Rupees 400 million. Out of the total of Rupees 400 million , the long term Liability is Rupees 150 million .  The current Liability of Rupees 250 million consists of Bank Over Draft of Rupees 100 million , short term borrowing of Rupees of 50 million , creditor of Rupees 50 million , provisions of Rupees25 million and other current Liability of Rupees 25 million . 
Now , you have to fill up thes figures in Form III. First we fill up bank borrowing amount of Rupees 100 million and then other current Liability of Rupees 150 million. Other current Liability is total current Liability minus Bank Over Draft .  In this case the amount is Rupees 250 million minus Rupees 100 million.  Then you would fill up the long term Liability . In this case it i Rupees150 million.  Then the net worth amount is filled up at Rupees 200 million.
Once the Liability side is filled up , you have to fill up the asset side of Form III. In the asset side , you have to first fill up the current asset part . In this case ,  we have taken a current asset amount of Rupees 400 million as against Rupees 450 million of Balance Sheet figure . This is due to the fact that loans to group companies is Rupees 50 million and this should not be included in the current asset in CMA form III. 
After current asset , you would fill up net fixed asset and the amount is Rupees 100 million . Last , you would fill up non current asset part and this amount is Rupees 100 million.  Please note that non current asset amount of CMA Form III comprises of Investment of Rupees 50 million and Loans and advances to group comanies excluded from current asset to th tune of Rupees 50 million .

once the liability side is filled up , you have to fill up the asset side of form iii. in the asset side , you have to first fill up the current asset part . in this case , we have taken a current asset amount of rupees 400 million as against rupees 450 million of balance sheet figure . this is due to the fact that loans to group companies is rupees 50 million and this should not be included in the current asset in cma form iii. 
after current asset , you would fill up net fixed asset and the amount is rupees 100 million . last , you would fill up non current asset part and this amount is rupees 100 million. please note that non current asset amount of cma form iii comprises of investment of rupees 50 million and loans and advances to group comanies excluded from current asset to th tune of rupees 50 million .

Net worth has been found out at Rupees  200 million and the total outside Liability has been calculated at Rupees 400 million. Out of the total of Rupees 400 million , the long term Liability is Rupees 150 million .  The current Liability of Rupees 250 million consists of Bank Over Draft of Rupees 100 million , short term borrowing of Rupees of 50 million , creditor of Rupees 50 million , provisions of Rupees25 million and other current Liability of Rupees 25 million . &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="8" color="#000000"&gt;Now , you have to fill up thes figures in Form III.
