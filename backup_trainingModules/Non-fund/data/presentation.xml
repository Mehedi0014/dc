			<notes>LC deals with documents, not goods. However, the ultimate payment will take place after selling of goods. Besides, the intention of buyer and seller should be good i.e. buyer should be willing to make payment and his financial position should be good. Similarly, seller should also deliver goods as per specifications. 
The maximum risk in issuing LC is towards issuing bank. Therefore the issuing bank must ensure that due diligence has been conducted at the time opening the LC. 
Precaution exercised by LC Opening / Issuing Bank: 
LC applicant’s financial position would determine the payment in due date . 
If LC applicant and beneficiaries are dealing with for longer period , risk is lower . If it is a new relationship , issuing bank must ensure proper  risk mitigant like higher cash margin or higher security . 
Nature of goods : In case the goods purchased under LC is of volatile nature the risk is high. It may happen that by the time documents under LC reach the buyer , the price of the goods has fallen and the buyer may not accept the documents . 
Credit check of the beneficiary : If the LC amount is large enough , credit opinion about current financial position of the beneficiary has to be checked . In case seller’s financial positions are not good , the seller may submit proper documents but ship defective goods. 
Operating cycle versus usance period : If operating cycle of the buyer is more than the usance period of LC , opening bank must ensure proper fund based working capital limit . 
Foreign exchange risk under import LC : LC opening bank must ensure proper hedging is in place at the time of opening of LC.

If the importer’s business model is that the importer will import goods but sells the same in cash, banks should verify the actual sales. 
The importer may also pay fund under advance remittances without actual goods getting imported later. The banks or customers do not follow up the overseas exporter for delivery.
The money is remitted outward without receipt of any material from the supplier.
If in a country, outward foreign currency movement restriction is on the higher side, then the chances of over invoicing is also on the higher side.

In such case, the importer would pay less tax on sales side due to understatement of import. The difference amount would be transmitted through Hawala channel.
Note
Import based money laundering can also happen when actual import is not taking place but money has been paid. .

Note
In case of service industry, it is very difficult to find out such over invoicing.</text>
