			<notes>Let us begin with an overview.
Before going in to details of FOREX business, you should know first why we, Indian, should be bothered about FOREX ? 

India has to arrange FOREX to meet its commitment to outside world.

India can not print FOREX but India as a country requires FOREX for : 
Import of goods 
Payment of medical expenses of its citizens 
Repayment of loans taken from outside 

Let us now consider the nature of FOREX Markets. Internationally and in India, the Forex markets are virtual as well as physical market where both capital account transactions ( both receipts and payments ) and current account transactions ( both receipts and payments) would be carried out.

India , as a country utilizes FOREX by two ways. Forex Receipts and Payments on both current account and capital account.

First let us look at Receipts. For example:
Current Account Receipts like export, foreign remittances by NRI, etc. 
Capital Account Receipts like NRI Deposits, External Commercial Borrowings ( ECB), etc.

2) Next we consider Payments. For example,
 Current Account Payments  like import bill, outward remittances, etc. 
Capital Account Payments  like  repayment of NRI Deposits, repayment of External Commercial Borrowings ( ECB), etc.

Now let us look at the importance of FOREX Management from the perspective of the Indian Economy. Please click the next slide button to continue.</notes>

			<notes>Here, we shall look at the importance of the Forex market and forex management for the Indian economy as part of the Forex Market overview. Please note that Management and control of Foreign exchange is critical for the stability of the economy. Please consider the following aspects:

1) Stable exchange rate.  As the exchange rate is dependent on the Foreign exchange demand and supply, proper management ensures that the central bank has the ability to manage supply to meet the demand for forex in the market.
2) Meeting the demand for Forex. In the global economy, import of critical items, such as fuel, technology and other important items have an impact on the economy. The supply of Forex is critical to manage the steady flow of goods and services for which India is dependent on other countries.
3) Reducing speculation &amp; other manipulations. The regulation of Forex ensures that the illegal activities are not carried out in the Forex market. The management of Forex allows the government to monitor the money laundering, funding of subversive and terrorist activities etc. which may have a impact on the security of the country and the economy as a whole.
4) Controlled and regulated supply of Forex allows the Government to manage the reserves of Forex and supply to the market. This impacts the overall credit rating and the credit rating of the economy as a whole.
5) Overall, Forex plays a very important role in maintaining and managing the stability of the economy. The Government regulates and strictly monitors the Forex activities in the economy through various acts and legislations. 

The banker must be very careful and be aware of the regulations and policies with respect to Forex. Plese click the next slide button to continue.
